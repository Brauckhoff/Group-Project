## Downloading data sets

The data sets used by @... were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra, accessed 17.01.2026] The accession numbers can be viewed in the README.md on github. For the download the SRA-toolkit (v3.2.1-ubuntu64) was used, namely the command `prefetch` for downloading SRA files and fastq-dump for extracting the fastq files. The produced python script was based on the github tutorial by Erick Lu^[https://erilu.github.io/python-fastq-downloader/]. The script was later modified to run on multiple cores to parallelize the download. As no specfic instructions regarding the download where given by the paper the default options where used for both commands, except increasing the maximum allowed file size to be downloaded by prefetch to 100G with the -X tag. The result of this was a folder with all requested SRR-IDs in gzip compressed fastq format.

## Assemblers

As already mentioned in the introduction, the main objective of this reproduction was to compare the current version of the three assemblers used to the performance shown in the paper 3 years ago. 

### MetaMDBG

The paper employed the v0.3 of the metaMDBG assembler. The following flags used in the paper could be translated to the current version: -t is now --threads, representing the number of cores that should be used. Searching for -d in the older version on github, results in the translation to string density. This likely represents --density-assembly in the current version, which is kept at the default of 0.005. The -l tag was found to be string minimal size and was translated as --kmer-size. Leading to the following general command used:

metaMDBG asm --out-dir ./<SRR-ID>/ --in-hifi <path-to-fastq.gz> --threads 16 --kmer-size 13

A bash script was written streamlining the assembly for all SRR-IDs, namely assemble.sh. Due to a path issue in one of the runs, the second version contains the same commands with absolute directory paths.

for u to do :)

### hifiasm-meta

for u to do :)

## Analysis 

The aim of the analysis was to keep everything as close to the paper as possible, to be able to attribute the changes to the newer versions of assemblers. Therefore the packages used for analysis used the original versions mentioned in the paper. The command for the python environment can be found on github, detailing the individual versions used. For the analysis and reproduction of Table S3 and S4, the github repository from the paper was employed.^[https://github.com/GaetanBenoitDev/MetaMDBG_Manuscript, accessed 17.01.2026] ... maybe a sentence intro to ur approaches/topics

### Assess circular contigs

### Assess non-circular MAGs (binning)

### Assess assembly completeness and fragmentation with reference sequences


### Assess viral contigs

### Prediction of tRNA and rRNA
